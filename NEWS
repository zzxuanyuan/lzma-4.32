===============================

Version 4.32.1

  * Explicitly check that closing the output file succeeds.
    Fixes a rare but possible silent data loss.
  
  * Close stdout and stderr and check that those operations succeed.
    Again, fixes a rare but possible silent data loss.
  
  * Some help message, documentation, and typo fixes to various places.

  * Added replacement function for GNU getopt_long(). This should make
    the command line tool build on a few more operating systems.
